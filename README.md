# hello-world

Hi!

I'm Licheng and I'm studying Science and Commerce at the University of Auckland. My majors are Data Science and Information Management. I enjoy fitness, cooking, reading, and I want to get better at programming and statistics!

This repository stores the files related to the Hello World project organised by github to help newbies become more familiar with the service.
